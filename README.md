Machine learning models like Logistic regression,Kth nearest neighbour,Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector machine are trained with this preprocessed data.
Model with highest accuracy is being implemented to get the results.
A webpage is created using the model where in any user can put his/her mail and check whether it's a spam or ham.
